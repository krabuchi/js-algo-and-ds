# Data Structures 

## Linked List
    * Every List has a head, a tail and next property.
    * Takes less memory
    * Not recommended for search and insertions;

## Doubly Linked List
    * Every List has a head, a tail a next and a previous property 
    * Takes more memory than Singly Linked List

## Stack
## Queue
## Binary Tree

## Binary Heaps
    - Heap is tree structure similar to binary tree.
    - all children are smaller than maxBinaryHeap.
    - all children are larger than minBinaryHeap.
    - binary heap is as compact as possible(least amount of space).
    - left children always fill out first.
    - no implied ordering between siblings.
    - used to implement Priority Queues.
    - relation parent to left child -> 2n + 1
    - relation parent to right child -> 2n + 2
    - relation child to parent (n - 1) / 2
